# Jean-Louis Usable Light Syntax theme for Atom

A light syntax theme for Atom, which tries to be more usable.

## Why ?
For old people like me with bad eyes...

- The contrast is maximized by using a black color instead of gray nuances.
- The font size is bigger

## Installation

To install this Atom package, just do:
```
apm install jean-louis-usable-light-syntax
```

Or open Atom, and go the menu File -> Settings -> Install and then
look for the theme `jean-louis-usable-light-syntax` and click on the Install
button.

## Note

This code has been a fork of the https://github.com/atom/atom-light-syntax project.
